	<h2 class="title">ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p class="aboutMe">My name is TIm Blake and I am currently looking for a job persuing my passion as a front-end Web developer. I have strong HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT skills. Check out some of my projects on the projects portion on this site. I consider myself a creative problem solver and I love the thrill of a challenge. I started off as a mechanic at a young age having a natural talent for diagnosing and fixing problems. It was a tough trade but I worked my way up close to being certified as a master technician because of my hard work and passion for problem solving.  After 7 years in the field I l felt like there were greater opportunties  where I could apply my problem solving and diagnostic abilities. After alot of research and practice I fell in love with web development/programming and it brought me to resilient coders. They have been an amazing help teaching me and giving me an oppurtunity to really develop my skillset to work my way into the tech industry. I an a hard worker, a team player, and I get things done.
